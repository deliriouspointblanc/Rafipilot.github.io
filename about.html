    <h1>About</h1> 
    <p> Hello, my name is Rafayel Latif, I am 13 years old and am home-schooled. At the age of 12, I took GCSEs in Maths, Physics and Further Maths, achieving two 8's and a 7. This year I am working towards Chemistry, Computer Science and English language GCSEs as well as my A-levels in Maths and Physics which I hope to take in 2024. 
      I was always a normal student when at school but all the extra time I have at home has helped me learn much more quicky! I have also been able to focus on subjects l love, going deep and exploring whatever I want to ðŸ˜Š The freedom has been my favourite thing!
      In addition, I am grade 5 piano working towards my grade 6. This is especially cool as I only started to play (using Simply Piano) 2.5 years ago.
      My true love, however, is cricket. I have been playing since I was three years old and have played at borough level (Middlesex u10s, Middlesex u12s). I love the sport as it is social, exciting and a summer game. My dad and brothers also play so it has become a family thing, which is also a plus.
      

    </p>
